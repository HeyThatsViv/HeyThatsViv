### Hi I'm Vivienne ðŸ‘‹

I am a data scientist with a degree in Biology and a dynamic background in health tech and education. I have experience in the data science process from data acquisition to model evaluation. My strong ability to creatively solve problems and tell stories through data comes from approaching challenges with curiosity and a desire to learn.

A variety of career experiences has forced me to grow and stretch in ways that constantly pushed me beyond my boundaries. Experiences like working in genetics research, managing a team of employees, personal tutoring, and teaching high school science have challenged me and shaped me into the person I am today. I am an effective communicator, leader, and collaborator, who legitimately enjoys tackling hard goals.

Please feel free to look through my projects pinned to my page.
